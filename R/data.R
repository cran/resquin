#' NEP-Scale GESIS Panel Campus File
#'
#' Responses on 15 items of the NEP scale (Dunlap et al., 2002) measuring attitudes towards
#' the environment. The data is from the GESIS Panel
#' Campus File (Bosnjak et al., 2017, GESIS Data Archive, 2025), which is a subset of the
#' full GESIS Panel. The GESIS Panel is a probability based general population
#' panel survey sampling from the German population.
#'
#' Responses are on a five point response scale, which has been inverted
#' from its original coding:
#' *  5 = Fully agree
#' *  4 = Agree
#' *  3 = Neither nor
#' *  2 = Don’t agree
#' *  1 = Fully disagree
#'
#' Note that some of the items are reverse coded, meaning that
#' higher agreement with the scale can either indicate more concern
#' for nature (e.g. bczd017a: Balance of nature is very sensitive),
#' while higher agreement to other items implies less concern for
#' nature (bczd005a: Approaching maximum number of humans).Thus,
#' straightling behavior is much less likely a result of valid
#' responding.
