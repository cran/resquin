#' Compute response nondifferentiation indicators
#'
#' Compute response nondifferentiation indicators for responses to multi-item scales or matrix
#' questions.
#'
#' @param x A data frame containing survey responses in wide format. For more information
#' see section "Data requirements" below.
#' @param min_valid_responses Numeric between 0 and 1 of length 1. Defines the share of valid responses
#' a respondent must have to calculate response quality indicators. Default is 1.
#' @param id default is `True`. If the default value is supplied
#' a column named `id` with integer ids will be created. If `False` is supplied, no id column will be created. Alternatively, a numeric or character vector of unique values identifying
#' each respondent can be supplied. Needs to be of the same length as the number of rows of `x`.
#'
#' @details
#' Response nondifferentiation is the result of response behavior in which respondents deviate
#' from an ideal response process. Optimal response behavior is termed optimizing, while deviations from
#' optimal response behavior are termed satisficing (Krosnik, 1991). Optimizing describes a behavior in which
#' respondents go through all steps of comprehension, retrieval, judgment, and response selection. When satisficing,
#' respondents skip all or parts of the optimal response process. Satisficing can lead to non-response, "don't know"
#' responses, random responding or nondifferentiation. The later is targeted by the function `resp_nondifferentiation()`.
#'
#' Nondifferentiation is characterized by respondents choosing similar or even the same response options regardless of the
#' content of the question. Multiple indicators for response nondifferentiation have been developed.
#' For `resp_nondifferentiation()`, the following response nondifferentiation indicators described by Kim et al. (2017) are calculated per respondent:
#' \itemize{
#'    \item Simple Nondifferentiation: Respondents are assigned 1 or 0 depending on
#'    whether all responses have the same value (1) or not (0).
#'    \item Mean Root of Pairs Method: Mean of the root of the absolute differences between all pairs in a multi-item
#'    scale or matrix questions. It ranges from 0 (least straightlining) to 1 (most straightlining). The indicator is rescaled to be
#'    inbetween the minimum and maximum of all values. This means that including/excluding responses or respondents into the calculation
#'    changes the indicators values.
#'    \item Maximum Identical Rating Method: Proportion of the most commonly selected response option among all responses in a multi-item
#'    scale or matrix questions. It ranges from 0 (least straightlining) to 1 (most straightlining).
#'    \item Scale Point Variation Method: The probability of differentiation is defined as \eqn{1-\Sigma{p_i^2}},
#'     where \eqn{p_i} is the proportion of the values rated at each scale point on a rating scale and \eqn{i} indicates the number of scale points.
#'     The measure becomes larger if respondents use more scales points in a multi-item scale or matrix questions.
#' }
#'
#' It should be noted that Kim et al. (2017) average the response nondifferentiation indicators to obtain an aggregate
#' measure for response nondifferentiation. To do so, the `summary()` function can be called on the
#' results of `resp_nondifferentiation()`. Additionally, Kim et al. (2017) removed all respondents with missing
#' values from their study. For `resp_nondifferentiation()` this is the default behavior (`min_valid_responses = 1`).
#' Reducing the value of `min_valid_responses` can lead to problems. For example, respondents with less valid respones
#' will have less of an opportunity to use all response options which in turn is used to calculate the
#' Scale Point Variation Method indicator. Thus, consider whether allowing missing responses impacts the results
#' indicators and subsequent analyses.

#'
#' @section Data requirements:
#' `resp_nondifferentiationf()` assumes that the input data frame is structured in the following way:
#' * The data frame is in wide format, meaning each row represents one respondent,
#' each column represents one variable.
#' * The variables are in same the order as the questions respondents
#' saw while taking the survey.
#' * Reverse keyed variables are in their original form. No items were recoded.
#' * All responses have integer values.
#' * Questions have the same number of response options.
#' * Missing values are set to `NA`.
#'
#'
#' @returns Returns a data frame with response nondifferentiation indicators per respondent.
#'  Dimensions:
#'  * Rows: Equal to number of rows in x.
#'  * Columns: Four response nondifferentiation indicator columns + id column (if specified).
