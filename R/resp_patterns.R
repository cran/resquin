## Response pattern indicators
#
#' Compute response pattern indicators
#'
#' Compute response pattern indicators for responses to multi-item scales or matrix
#' questions.
#'
#' @param x A data frame containing survey responses in wide format. For more information
#' see section "Data requirements" below.
#' @param min_valid_responses Numeric between 0 and 1 of length 1. Defines the share of valid responses
#' a respondent must have to calculate response pattern indicators. Default is 1.
#' @param defined_patterns An optional vector of integer values with patterns to search for or a list of integer vectors.
#'  Will not be computed if not specified or if an empty vector is supplied.
#' @param arbitrary_patterns An optional vector of integer values or a list containing vectors of
#' integer values. The values determine the pattern that should be searched for.
#' Will not be computed if not specified or if 0 is supplied.
#' @param min_repetitions Defines number of times an arbitrary pattern
#'    has to be repeated to be retained in the results. Must be larger or equal to 2.
#' @param id default is `True`. If the default value is supplied
#' a column named `id` with integer ids will be created. If `False` is supplied, no id column will be created. Alternatively, a numeric or character vector of unique values identifying
#' each respondent can be supplied. Needs to be of the same length as the number of rows of `x`.
#'
#' @details
#' The following response distribution indicators are calculated per respondent:
#' \itemize{
#'    \item n_transitions: Number of times two consecutive response options differ.
#'    \item mean_string_length: Mean length of strings of identical answers.
#'    \item longest_string_length: Longest length of string of identical answers.
#'    \item (optional) defined_pattern: A list column that contains one named vector
#'    per respondent. The names of the vector are repeating patterns found in the
#'    responses of a respondent. The values of the vector are how often the pattern
#'    specified in the argument "defined_patterns" occurs. See section "Defined patterns" for
#'    more information.
#'    \item (optional) arbitrary_patterns: A list column that contains one named vector
#'    per respondent. The names of the vector are repeating patterns found in the
#'    responses of a respondent. The values of the vector are how often the pattern
#'    occurred. See "Arbitrary patterns" for more information.
#' }
#'
#' # Defined and arbitrary pattern indicators
#' Responses of an individual respondent can follow patterns, such as zig-zagging
#' across the response scale over multiple items. There might be a-priori knowledge
#' which response patterns could occur and might be indicative of low quality
#' responding. For this case the defined_patterns argument can be used to specify
#' one or more patterns whose presence will be checked for each respondent. If
#' no a-priori knowledge exists, it is possible to check for all patterns of a
#' specified length.
#'
#' ## Defined patterns
#' A pattern is defined by providing one ore more patterns in a character vector.
#' A few examples: `resp_patterns(x,defined_patterns = c(1,2,3)` checks how
#' often the response pattern 1,2,3 occurs in the responses of a single respondent.
#' `list(c(1,2,3),c(3,2,1))` checks how often
#' the two patterns 1,2,3 and 3,2,1 occur individually in the responses of a single
#' respondent. There is no limit to the number of patterns.
#'
#' ## Arbitrary patterns
#' Checks for arbitrary patterns are defined by providing one ore more integer values
#' in a numeric vector. The integers must be larger or equal to two. A few examples:
#' `resp_patterns(x,arbitrary_patterns = 2)` will check for sequences of responses
#' of length two which repeat at least two times.
#' `resp_patterns(x,arbitrary_patterns = c(2,3,4,5))` will check for sequences of responses
#' of length two, three, four and five that repeat at least two times.
#'
#'
#' # Data requirements
#' `resp_patterns()` assumes that the input data frame is structured in the following way:
#' * The data frame is in wide format, meaning each row represents one respondent,
#' each column represents one variable.
#' * The variables are in same the order as the questions respondents
#' saw while taking the survey.
#' * Reverse keyed variables are in their original form. No items were recoded.
#' * All responses have integer values.
#' * Questions have the same number of response options.
#' * Missing values are set to `NA`.
#'
#'
#' @returns Returns a data frame with response quality indicators per respondent.
#'  Dimensions:
#'  * Rows: Equal to number of rows in x.
#'  * Columns: Three response pattern indicators + one column for defined patterns
#'   (if specified) + one column for arbitrary patterns (if specified) + one id column (if specified).
